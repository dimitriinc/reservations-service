# Fortune 50
A learning project of mine. Initially I wanted to practice making multiple API calls and displaying the data on a Grid layout. The idea is to get an array of 50 most valuable companies in the world and put in the grid, then, on click, display a more detailed information about the selected company. I didn't find a public API that would allow to request and sort all the companies by their total revenue (like in Fortune 500), so I went for sorting companies based on their market capitalization, and hence entered the world of stock exchanges. I don't display one array of 50 most valuable companies, I display top 50 companies on a certain stock exchange. For now I settled on two biggest ones: NYSE and NASDAQ.
Also, I decided to build the project with Webpack, which is my first experience with it. So it's me learning to configure and work with Webpack as well.

## Functionality
The user can choose the stock exchange, by default the companies of NASDAQ are displayed first. To get this initial data I use the Financial Modeling Prep API.
When the user clicks on a company, a dialog is presented, containing three pieces of information:
- history of stock prices for the selected company, presented in the form of a linear graph (constructed with the Char.js library). There are three time spans available for the historical data: month, quarter, year. Based on the selected option, I request the data from the Polygon.io API and get agregate bars over the selected date range, build and array of closing stock prices for the day, and feed the array to a resampling algorithm, that compresses the initial array into an array of a predefined length (for now it's 15). Then I feed the compressed array into a graph builder to display it on the screen. The idea is to dumb down the data and present the general trends of the company's evaluation. Also, I was curious about resampling algorithms.
- general information about the company, like its description, address, sector, etc. The API I use to get this data is Polygon.io as well (different endpoint though).
- some statistical numbers that help me to illustrate the company's performance over time, such as it total revenue, gross profit, depreciation, and interest income. Those stats are chosen by me on arbitrary basis. This data comes from Alpha Vantage API.

## FYI
All the data comes from free-tier APIs. For certain companies those APIs have no information at all. Additionally, there are limits for calls. For example Polygon.io has 5 calls per minute limit, Alpha Vantage doesn't allow more than 100 calls a day. All those restrictions I tried to mitigate with proper error handling, and display appropriate error messages instead of the data.
